The project is about the readmission of a diabetic patient in the hospital within 14 days of the discharge after diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetic. This is a classification problem which includes more than 100K records and 50 variables among which 30 are categorical and 11 continuous. The data is collected from 130 hospitals over a span of 10 years (1999-2008). After extensive data preprocessing and data cleaning, I came up with 49734 records over 30 different predictors to classify the readmission of a diabetic patient. 
Out of the various classification algorithms, I have implemented CART and Logistic Regression on the dataset. I have performed 2 class classification where these two algorithm are implemented over the full dataset as well as the reduced dataset. In logistic regression, I have implemented the forward variable selection method to perform variable reduction, which will avoid model overfitting. I have interpreted the result of the model by configuring lift curve, confusion matrix, and AUC, which determine the accuracy of the model. Another Algorithm is CART, which uses the full dataset to build the model. The CART algorithm is extremely simple and contains just one variable to classify the readmission of a patient. Even both Full tree and the Best-Prune tree give similar result. In real life, it is impossible to classify the readmission by considering just one predictor. Hence I choose, Logistic regression machine learning algorithm over CART.
